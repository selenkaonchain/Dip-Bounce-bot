# Dip-Bounce-bot
The bot monitors real-time order books via WebSocket, detects short-term price dips, places buy orders, and exits positions based on configurable rebound targets and time-based risk controls.  This repository contains a patched and hardened version with robust fill detection, improved sell logic, and race-condition protection.
